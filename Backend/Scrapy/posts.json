Leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) to monitor outpatient clinical encounters may lead to the identification of emerging outbreaks.\n\n\nObjective: The aim of this study is to investigate whether excess visits where the word \u201ccough\u201d was present in the EHR reason for visit, and hospitalizations with acute respiratory failure were more frequent from December 2019 to February 2020 compared with the preceding 5 years.\n\n\nMethods: A retrospective observational cohort was identified from a large US health system with 3 hospitals, over 180 clinics, and 2.5 million patient encounters annually. Data from patient encounters from July 1, 2014, to February 29, 2020, were included. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time-series models were used to evaluate if the observed winter 2019/2020 rates were higher than the forecast 95% prediction intervals. The estimated excess number of visits and hospitalizations in winter 2019/2020 were calculated compared to previous seasons.\n\n\nResults: The percentage of patients presenting with an EHR reason for visit containing the word \u201ccough\u201d to clinics exceeded the 95% prediction interval the week of December 22, 2019, and was consistently above the 95% prediction interval all 10 weeks through the end of February 2020. Similar trends were noted for emergency department visits and hospitalizations starting December 22, 2019, where observed data exceeded the 95% prediction interval in 6 and 7 of the 10 weeks, respectively. The estimated excess over the 3-month 2019/2020 winter season, obtained by either subtracting the maximum or subtracting the average of the five previous seasons from the current season, was 1.6 or 2.0 excess visits for cough per 1000 outpatient visits, 11.0 or 19.2 excess visits for cough per 1000 emergency department visits, and 21.4 or 39.1 excess visits per 1000 hospitalizations with acute respiratory failure, respectively. The total numbers of excess cases above the 95% predicted forecast interval were 168 cases in the outpatient clinics, 56 cases for the emergency department, and 18 hospitalized with acute respiratory failure.\n\n\nConclusions: A significantly higher number of patients with respiratory complaints and diseases starting in late December 2019 and continuing through February 2020 suggests community spread of SARS-CoV-2 prior to established clinical awareness and testing capabilities. This provides a case example of how health system analytics combined with EHR data can provide powerful and agile tools for identifying when future trends in patient populations are outside of the expected ranges.\n\nJ Med Internet Res 2020;22(9):e21562\n\n\ndoi:10.2196/21562\n\n\nhttps://www.jmir.org/2020/9/e21562/#Copyright",

Since the influenza disease burden is substantial and oseltamivir treatment is biologically plausible, we assessed the clinical benefit of oseltamivir treatment in adult patients admitted with severe seasonal influenza virus infection in daily practice.\nPatients and methods:  A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of treatment with and without oseltamivir <48 hours after admission in patients admitted with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection in three large hospitals in the Netherlands. Propensity score matching was used to compare clinical relevant outcome variables.\nResults:  We included 390 patients, of whom 80% had comorbidity. Thirty-day mortality, as well as the composite endpoint of 30-day mortality or intensive care unit admission >48 hours after admission, were reduced by 9% (p= 0.04) and 11% (p= 0.02) respectively. Length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality rates all showed a trend towards reduction. The median duration between symptom onset and initiation of treatment was three days.\nConclusions:  This study supports that, in daily practice, patients admitted with influenza virus infection should be treated with oseltamivir within 48 hours of admission, even if they have complaints for more than 48 hours.\n\nKeywords:  Complications; Influenza; Mortality; Oseltamivir; Treatment.",

In a field experiment, replicate filtered surface water samples inoculated with duck swabs were tested for IAVs upon collection and again after an overwintering period of approximately 6-7 months. Numerous IAVs were molecularly detected and isolated from these samples, including replicates maintained at wetland field sites in Alaska and Minnesota for 181-229 days. In a parallel laboratory experiment, we attempted to culture IAVs from filtered surface water samples inoculated with duck swabs from Minnesota each month during September 2018-April 2019 and found monthly declines in viral viability. In an experimental challenge study, we found that IAVs maintained in filtered surface water within wetlands of Alaska and Minnesota for 214 and 226 days, respectively, were infectious in a mallard model. Collectively, our results support surface waters of northern wetlands as a biologically important medium in which IAVs may be both transmitted and maintained, potentially serving as an environmental reservoir for infectious IAVs during the overwintering period of migratory birds.\n\nKeywords:  avian; environment; influenza; persistence; reservoir; wetland.",

However, to the best of our knowledge, the underlying mechanism of this is unknown. The present study revealed that a monoclonal antibody (H1\u201184mAb) against the H1N1 influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein cross\u2011reacted with an antigen from brain tissue. Total brain tissue protein was immunoprecipitated with this cross\u2011reactive antibody, and mass spectrometry revealed that the bound antigens were heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 and hnRNPA2/B1. Subsequently, the two proteins were expressed in bacteria and it was demonstrated that H1\u201184mAb bound to hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2/B1. These two proteins were expressed in three segments and the cross\u2011reactivity of H1\u201184mAb with the glycine (Gly)\u2011rich domains of hnRNPA1 (195aa\u2011320aa) and hnRNPA2/B1 (202aa\u2011349aa) was determined using ELISA blocking experiments. It was concluded that the Gly\u2011rich domains of these two proteins are heterophilic antigens that cross\u2011react with influenza virus HA.

Firstly, we cloned in the pHW2000 plasmid each of the eight gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, hemagglutinin [HA], neuraminidase [NA], NS, NP, M) of two master donor strains (MDS), respectively, A/Yunnan/1/2005Vca(H3N2) and B/Yunnan/2/2005Vca(By), which had Vca phenotype (cold-adapted phenotype in Vero cells). Secondly, the similar operation was implemented with each of the HA, NA and NP segments of circulating strains with epidemic potential (parental strains). The virus rescue techniques were employed in this study, according to the homology rate of HA segments between MDS and parental strains. Then, we harvested amount of new Vca virus strains. By transmission electron microscope, it could observe new viruses' diameter and length were from 100 to 120 nm. Importantly, these reassortant viruses could get high-yield production in Vero cells at 25\u2103 from the beginning to the fourth generation, which was significantly differ from their original parental viruses. Additional, these production 16 new Vca strains could maintain enough antibody binding capacity and attenuation phenotype, which consisted with their MDS.

This systematic review describes the prevalence, spatiotemporal distribution, and virus subtypes detected in domestic and wild birds for the past two decades (2000-2019). We collected data from three electronic databases, PubMed, SpringerLink electronic journals and African Journals Online, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. A total of 1656 articles were reviewed, from which 68 were selected. An overall prevalence of 3.0% AIV in birds was observed. The prevalence varied between regions and ranged from 1.1% to 7.1%. The Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test showed no significant difference in the prevalence of AIV across regions, \u03c72(3) = 5.237, p = 0.1553 and seasons, T = 820, z = -1.244, p = 0.2136. Nineteen hemagglutinin/neuraminidase subtype combinations were detected during the reviewed period, with southern Africa recording more diverse AIV subtypes than other regions. The most detected subtype was H5N1, followed by H9N2, H5N2, H5N8 and H6N2. Whilst these predominant subtypes were mostly detected in domestic poultry, H1N6, H3N6, H4N6, H4N8, H9N1 and H11N9 were exclusively detected in wild birds. Meanwhile, H5N1, H5N2 and H5N8 were detected in both wild and domestic birds suggesting circulation of these subtypes among wild and domestic birds. Our findings provide critical information on the eco-epidemiology of AIVs that can be used to improve surveillance strategies for the prevention and control of avian influenza in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nKeywords:  Orthomyxoviridae; avian influenza; avian influenza virus; ecology; epidemiology; poultry; sub-Saharan Africa; subtype; wild waterfowl.",

Public health authorities have progressively expanded recommendations for vaccination against influenza, particularly to the pediatric population. However, the potential mismatch between the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) strains and those circulating during the season remains an issue. Quadrivalent vaccines improves vaccines effectiveness by preventing any potential mismatch on influenza B lineages.\nMethods:  We evaluate the public health and economic benefits of the switch from TIV to QIV for the pediatric influenza recommendation (6mo-5yo) by using a dynamic epidemiological model able to consider the indirect impact of vaccination. Results of the epidemiological model are then imputed in a health-economic model adapted to the Brazilian context. We perform deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to account for both epidemiological and economical sources of uncertainty.\nResults:  Our results show that switching from TIV to QIV in the Brazilian pediatric population would prevent 406,600 symptomatic cases, 11,300 hospitalizations and almost 400 deaths by influenza season. This strategy would save 3400 life-years yearly for an incremental direct cost of R$169 million per year, down to R$86 million from a societal perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the switch would be R$49,700 per life-year saved and R$26,800 per quality-adjusted life-year gained from a public payer perspective, and even more cost-effective from a societal perspective. Our results are qualitatively similar in our sensitivity analysis.\nConclusions:  Our analysis shows that switching from TIV to QIV to protect children aged 6mo to 5yo in the Brazilian influenza epidemiological context could have a strong public health impact and represent a cost-effective strategy from a public payer perspective, and a highly cost-effective one from a societal perspective.\n\nKeywords:  Brazil; Cost-effectiveness; Influenza; Public health; QIV; Quadrivalent; Vaccine.",

Univariate and multivariate logistical regression analyses were performed to determine the risk factors involved in the acquisition and 60-day mortality in IPA patients.\nResults:  Of the 693 FluA-p patients included in the study, 3.0% (21/693) were IPA patients with a 60-day mortality of 42.9% (9/21). Adjusted for confounders, a Cox proportional hazard model showed that IPA was associated with increased risk for 60-day mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 4.336, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.191-15.784, p = 0.026] in FluA-p patients.
